# Main question to answer: What is it like to live in Brooklyn (not Williamsburg)?

## What is the different between Manhattan and Brooklyn? 

Started off meatpacking, high crime, but as Wall Street moved in, wealth spread. Geographically segmented.
Williamsburg skips across the pond, wealth rises. Used to be a place for skateboarders. 

Farther out, still have the families from the 80s. 

## Where do I live? 

Gravesend
Sunset Park
40 minutes from Union Square

## Average price? 

Around 2008, many Chinese families started buying up property.
$700 for a small room, Brownstone style. $1000 in Williamsburg, $1500 in Manhattan

## Average meal price? 
$5 

## Places to buy food? 

Smaller supermarkets, less turnover, less standardization.

Not necessarily cheaper, because not wholesale.

Pioneer Mart. 

## You work in Manhattan; how do you deal with the commute? 

Audio books, a 10-hour audio book in a week. 

## Benefits:

Really get to know the heart and blood of New York. 
This is where all the Caviar and Seamlesss deliverers live. 
This is the working class. 

It is a privilege to live in Manhattan. The world's city was built off neighborhoods like Sunset Park. 

New York city is more than Manhattan, after a while it's literal Alphabet and number city. Jacob Riis projects. 

Pay homage to the real grit of New York. 

## Is it safe?

Children and family. 

Petit larceny, Trulia. 

Pepper spray at London Pharmacy. 

Install a security system. 

## What is my personal life like? 

It is a privilege to live in the NYC area. Frugal people, and there are people with money to spare. 

No AC. 
Bed up, table to the side.

## Is it my personal choice?

No not really. We all find ourselves in certain situations. My goal is to save, as long as I have something to do during my commute.

## Last thing I want to talk about is the Rental paradox:

Cities with high rents, are you paying for the space, if so then stay in it, if you're paying for the position, it is worth to be a bit far out. Lean up, become strong, stay healthy, keep chuggin. Lived in China, will make a vid of it later.
