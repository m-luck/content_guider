# Main Question: What makes a good book to read?

## Who vouches for books?

If you want to go over the run of the mill: Elon when young, Gates, Bezos. 

## What is a book to me?

We read books because a person spent upward of a dozen hours to distill information for you to ingest in half the time. In a way, it is an information compression engine. This is going to be a unique angle, it's not to enter a new world. I picture that like a stack, most of it disappears after you're done. It's to update the current one, has to have side effects. Lord of the Rings was great, but most of the culture reverberations have been: visit New Zealand, be noble, cosplay, music with flutes is beautiful. Propagation of moral values. It's great. 

## Nonfiction -- applies to documentation of real life in some way. 

Science based is best, but also stories can be easier to digest. 

A good book takes a common point of view and introduces nuance, history, and new developments. 

As information science is responsible for the uptick in techonological growth, recent books are important more than ever. 

## The Story of Human Behavior: training for marathon, more vids on that later, taught me how to best run with my feet and why.

## What if it's boring? 

Suck it up. Books, like TV, and food have easy material and have more tedious content. They take the same amount of time to consume, and the universe doesn't care which ones we can consume. Through a simple decision, we can capitilize on time for effectively. 

## Caveat: fiction is valuable

Stay human. Fiction is valuable. Fiction allows us to explore what we can imagine, and helps remind us of the hero's journey. Now how do we each make our own journey? We learn facts grounded in reality. A good mix are biographies, like Arnold Schwarznegger's biography. 

## What can fiction be good for in society? 

Severe exploration, not grounded, complete random chance, like magic. Good balance for reinforcement learning algorithms. 

## Okay back to nonfiction, Misbehave 

Richard Thaler tells us how to thrive in a economically incentivized environment. 

## Classics: Cutting edge mixed with tried and true

Genghis Khan, making of a modern world, and Mongol Queens. Shows how ancient wars were won, and the consistencies between then and now. 

## Does it lose touch? 

Ironic question. 

The adventures of wanderlust, like The Third Door, Iliza Schlesinger's Girl Logic. We look for human stories, and that doesn't stop at the land of the unreal. To imagine a better world for ourselves, we need imagination, and we also need implementation and demonstration. Some things are theory, and some things have happened. Sex and the city, fiction. Korean dramas, fiction. Big Bang theory, fiction. Live in fiction is dangerous. To take cliff notes of what happen can be helpful to suggest what can happen. If you think of it, all future is fiction, but futures grounded in nonfiction are more likely to become nonfiction. Think of books as completing the picture of initial conditions. Like Koch's market based management or Ray Dalio's principles, they shed light on remarkable almost mythical entities in real life, despite any critiques. That's amazing to me and not boring at all. 

My favorite fiction was Whirligig. A human story, but profound and not real. My job as a scientist is to explore the world and compress it into a package which I can pull from. Black Mirror is fiction, but warns of a nonfiction future. We also have to look at nonfiction, where books were predicted to pitch generations into solitude -- Black Mirror is nothing more than that (more in a future video). The future is nonfiction/fiction at the same time, and the fiction is hope/warning, nonfiction is heeding warnings, and channeling hope. Terminator : AI Superpowers, Black Mirror : Googolplex, The Big Four.

I will reform this point of view the more books I read, and also as I read the comments. The quest for information continues.  

Gonna release some videos of similar vein. If you enjoyed this dialogue and want to follow the line of thought, feel free to do so. 

Bit about myself, neuroscience major fundamentally humanitarian, then to neuro economics, entered computer science, always enamored by management and systems. Look for the gems, look for the power bombs of information that are underexposed.
